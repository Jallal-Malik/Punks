BNB Punks: Tradition Reimagined
BNB Punks isn’t just a copy—it’s a celebration of the iconic CryptoPunks and their legendary status in the NFT world. Each of these 10,000 BNB Punks carries the same unique attributes, from classic accessories like wild hair, eye patches, and mohawks to those rare Punks with alien, zombie, and ape features. Every BNB Punk tells a story of rarity and individuality, just like its Ethereum counterpart.
